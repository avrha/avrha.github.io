<p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Simply, an OS supports a computerâ€™s basic function.</p>

<p>A computer consists of hardware, an operating system and application programs. The hardware consists of the CPU, I/O, memory, etc. Application programs consist of software intended for the end user; business and database programs are examples.</p>
