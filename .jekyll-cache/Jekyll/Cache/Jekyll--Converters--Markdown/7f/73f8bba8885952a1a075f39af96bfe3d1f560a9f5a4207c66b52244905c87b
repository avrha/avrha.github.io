Conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, it was adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, a free replacement for UNIX. Since then, Linus’ kernel has spawned numerous OS distributions commonly called Linux.</p>

<p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Simply, an OS supports a computer’s basic function.</p>

<p>Every general-purpose computer consists of the hardware, operating system, system and application programs. The hardware consist of memory, CPU, I/O, etc. System programs consist of compilers, loaders, editors, etc. Application programs consist of business and database programs.</p>

<p>As seen in the figure above, an operating system acts as an intermediary between the applications and hardware.</p>

<p>Every computer must have an operating system to run other programs. The OS coordinates the use of the hardware among the different system and application programs for various users.</p>
