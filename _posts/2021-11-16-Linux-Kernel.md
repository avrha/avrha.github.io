The Linux kernel is arguably the most important piece of software written in the age of computing. Conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, it was adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, a free replacement for UNIX. Since then, Linus’ kernel has spawned numerous OS distributions commonly called Linux.  

## Review on Operating Systems 
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. Simply, an OS supports a computer’s basic function. 

A computer consists of hardware, an operating system and application programs. The hardware consists of the CPU, I/O, memory, etc. Application programs consist of software intended for the end user; business and database programs are examples.

An operating system acts as a middleman between the application and hardware, coordinating the use of the hardware among different applications for various users. Hence, the OS provides an environment in which an user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently.  

The components of an operating system exist in order to ensure different parts of the computer work accordingly together. Remember, all user software needs to through the OS before touching any hardware.
