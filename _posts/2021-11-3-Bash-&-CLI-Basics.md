Bash is the default Unix shell installed on the majority of Linux distributions. Like any other shell, Bash uses a command-line interface (CLI) so its users can utilize the operating system. Therefore, knowledge of Bash's CLI is necessary for working with most Linux systems. This post covers the basics of Bash and the shell's CLI. 

## Basic Commands
Let's go over some basic commands. 

### pwd
```pwd``` prints the working directory telling the user where they are in the filesystem.

### ls
``` ls ``` lists a directory's contents. ``` ls ``` like many other Unix-like commands can take on arguments, options, and parameters. (More about this later)

### cd
``` cd ``` stands for change directory. As the command's name says, ``` cd ``` changes into directories within the Linux filesystem. ``` cd ``` can take in special characters like ``` . ```,  ``` .. ```, ``` - ``` or an absolute or relative path for its argument.
